# MongoDB Overview

- MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL (Not only SQL) is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data.
- MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.
- MongoDB is used for high-volume data storage, helping organizations store large amounts of data while still performing rapidly. Organizations also use MongoDB for its ad-hoc queries, indexing, load balancing, aggregation, server-side JavaScript execution and other features.
- nstead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, as a NoSQL database, the MongoDB architecture is made up of collections and documents. Documents are made up of Key-value pairs -- MongoDB's basic unit of data. Collections, the equivalent of SQL tables, contain document sets. MongoDB offers support for many programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Python, Ruby and Swift.

## MongoDB vs. RDBMS: What are the differences

- One of the main differences between MongoDB and RDBMS is that RDBMS is a relational database while MongoDB is nonrelational. Likewise, while most RDBMS systems use SQL to manage stored data, MongoDB uses BSON for data storage -- a type of NoSQL database
- While RDBMS uses tables and rows, MongoDB uses documents and collections. In RDBMS a table -- the equivalent to a MongoDB collection -- stores data as columns and rows. Likewise, a row in RDBMS is the equivalent of a MongoDB document but stores data as structured data items in a table. A column denotes sets of data values, which is the equivalent to a field in MongoDB.
- MongoDB is also better suited for hierarchical storage.
