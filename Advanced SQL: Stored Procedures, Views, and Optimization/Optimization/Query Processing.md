# Query Processing

- Query processing is the group of phases associated with extracting data from the database. It includes converting queries written in a high-level language such as SQL query optimizer into a form that the physical-level implementation of the database can understand, SQL query optimization techniques, and the original evaluation of the query.

- Parser and translator: The first step in query processing is parsing and translation. A parser, just like a parser in compilers, checks the syntax of the query to see whether the relations mentioned are present in the database. A high-level query language such as SQL query optimizer is suitable for human use. However, it is unsuitable for system internal representation. Therefore, translation is required. The internal representation can be an extended form of relational algebra.
- Optimization: An SQL query optimizer can be written in many ways. Its optimization also depends on how the data is stored in the file organization. A Query can also have different corresponding relational algebra expressions.
- Execution plan: A systematic step-by-step execution of primitive operations for fetching database data is called a query evaluation plan. Different evaluation plans for a particular query have different query costs. The cost may include the number of disk accesses, CPU time for executing the query, and communication time in the case of distributed databases.

## What is a Query optimization in SQL?

- Query optimization in SQL is enhancing the performance of a database query by modifying the queryâ€™s execution plan without altering its end result. The main goal is to reduce the time and resources required to retrieve the requested data from the database. Query optimization in SQL is crucial for ensuring efficient database operations, especially as the size of databases and the complexity of queries increase.
